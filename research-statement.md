### Objective: action-research discovery

Our current goal is not to tackle all these questions... yet. Before we can do that, we propose to lead an action-research\[2] initiative to **understand the context, actors, processes and tools** related to NFT for design and creativity. We'd also like to identify the overall dynamic that arises from being a designer immersed in that environment.

### Methodology: from zero to TBD

To go full cycle, we will **start from scratch, with zero network**. For that reason, we'll remain **anonymous**. But in order to gauge interest of the community, and get individual actors to verbalize about their role, we're **stating the goal transparently**.

### Expected Results

**Public retrospective journal** - We'll keep notes of the progress of this project, to eventually release them as a blog/journal at a milestone we'll determine, representing the end of a first experimentation cycle (ex: selling all the ideas).

**Proceeds** - Should this project raise any ETH, they will be well reinested on other research projects of the same nature, or spent on digital art (there is some seriously awesome content out there).
