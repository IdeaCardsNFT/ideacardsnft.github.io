From Compute-Aided Design to 3D Printing, all major digitalization breakthroughs have transformed the practice of design and creativity. Now Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) promise to drastically change the way we approach registering, crediting, sharing and selling creative work as digital assets. This is an opportunity for Design Science\[1] to investigate.

### Problem: too many undefined questions

There are so many open questions at this point, to name a few:

*   Can we qualify **NFT as a boundary object** between a designer and an open community of design actors?

*   Through NFT marketplaces, can we imagine a **standalone designer working like a digital artist** and selling their work to other stakeholders to implement and use? Is that a sustainable approach to design?

And overall, could we imagine a **decentralized design process** in which actors would use the blockchain as a computer-supported collaboration platform?

### Objective: action-research discovery

Our current goal is not to tackle all these questions... yet. Before we can do that, we propose to lead an action-research\[2] initiative to **understand the context, actors, processes and tools** related to NFT for design and creativity. We'd also like to identify and formalize the overall dynamic that arises from being a designer immersed in that environment.

### Methodology: from zero to TBD

To go full cycle, we will **start from scratch, with zero network**. For that reason, we'll remain **anonymous**. But in order to gauge interest of the community, and get individual actors to verbalize about their role, we're **stating the goal transparently**.

### Expected Results

**Public retrospective journal** - We'll keep notes of the progress of this project, to eventually release them as a blog/journal at a milestone we'll determine, representing the end of a first experimentation cycle (ex: selling all the ideas). We hope this will inform a more extensive research on some of key questions raised above.

**Proceeds** - Should this project raise any ETH, they will be well reinvested on other research projects of the same nature, or spent on digital art (there is some seriously awesome content out there).
