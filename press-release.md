> The #ideacards NFT experiment questions the future of ideation and intellectual property in the blockchain era.

A one-of-a-kind experiment invites you to **own an idea by buying it as a non-fungible tokens** (NFT). The project consists in **symbolically transferring ideas to the blockchain**: ideas never released before are drawn from scribbled paper notebooks, then a summary is minted as an NFT, finally all physical evidence is destroyed. The process is designed as a performance, but the question raised is very seriously considered by the industry today: **can NFT be used to trade intellectual property?**

#### Uploading ideas to the blockchain

Each idea has been condensed from sparse notes and scribbles into a one page summary, scanned and [published on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/ideacards/) for auction. To make each NFT a pure representation of the idea, all the **initial notes related to each idea have been destroyed**. You can actually see the [paper go down the shredder on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CN9NsbPBK0c/).

#### What ideas are we talking about?

Only 8 of the 17 ideas have been released so far and **their diversity is pretty evident**. For instance, you'll find a blockchain membership management idea, an app to practice generosity without object, and a 1-page novel in French. All they have in common is their format - handwritten, scanned - and some finish like a quick creativity workshop.

#### A short-term question for the industry

This experiment is not a random hack, it hits one of the major questions for the industry today: the use of\*\* NFT for management of intellectual property\*\*. This is already on the move. Recently, IBM and IPew announced a project for publishing patents as NFT. By equating the property of intellectual assets to the ownership of a non-fungible token, the intention is **to make the patent market more fluid** by letting IP assets be exchanged freely and programmatically through the blockchain. By foreseeing those changes, the #ideacards project is probing this new paradigm with mainstream adopters of NFT.

#### NFT as a field for design-research experimentation

The project is not digital art per se, but is using NFTs to make a point: NFTs are not only transforming digital art, they also will have a **long-term impact on the practice of design and creativity**. The #ideacards experiment is an early stage discovery of the nature of that impact both on the practice of ideation, and on the ecosystem supporting the trading of creative ideas.
