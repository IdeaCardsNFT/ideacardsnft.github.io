> The #ideacards NFT experiment questions the future of intellectual property and creativity in the age of the blockchain

A new creative project can let you **own an idea by buying it as a non-fungible tokens** (NFT). This artistic project consists in **symbolically transfering ideas to the blockchain**: original ideas are picked from scribbled paper notebooks, then a summary is minted as an NFT, finally all physical evidence is destroyed. The process is designed as a performance, but the question raised is very seriously considered by the industry today: **can NFT be used to trade intellectual property?**

#### NFT as an experimentation field

WIP The project is not digital art per se, but is using NFTs to make a point.

#### Uploading ideas to the blockchain

Each idea has been condensed from sparse notes and scribbles into a one page summary, scanned and published on [OpenSea]() for auction. To make each NFT a pure representation of the idea, all the **initial notes related to each idea have been destroyed**. You can actually see the paper go down the shredder on [instagram]().

#### What ideas are we talking about?

Only 8 of the 17 ideas have been released so far and **their diversity is pretty evident**. For instance, you'll find a blockchain membership management idea, an app to practice generosity without object, and a 1-page novel in French. All they have in common is their format - handwritten, scanned - and some finish like a brainstorming with friends.

#### A short-term question for the industry

his artistic experiment is not a random performance, it hits one of the major question for the industry today: the **use of NFT for management of intellectual property**. This is already on the move. Recently, IBM and IPew announced a project for publishing patents as NFT. By equating the property of intellectual assets to the ownership of a non-fungible token, the intention is **to make the patent market more fluid** by letting IP assets be exchanged freely and programmatically through the blockchain. By foreseeing those changes, the #ideacards project is probing this new paradigm with early mainstream adopters of NFT.
