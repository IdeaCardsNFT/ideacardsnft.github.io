          ## Probing the limits of IP on the blockchain


          This experiment tackles one of the major question for the industry
          today: the **use of NFT for management of intellectual property**.


          This is already on the move. Recently, IBM and IPew announced a
          project for publishing patents as NFT. By equating the property of
          intellectual assets to the ownership of a non-fungible token, the
          intention is **to make the patent market more fluid** by letting IP
          assets be exchanged freely and programmatically through the
          blockchain.


          By foreseeing those changes, the #ideacards project is probing this
          new paradigm with mainstream adopters of NFT.

          ## The impact of NFT on design


          New technologies such as CAD or 3D printing have changed design
          practice profoundly. Will NFT do the same?


          In a configuration where the **designer can register, credit, share
          and sell their ideas directly**, without middle person or other
          stakeholders, how will their role change in the production of value?


          Could we imagine a **decentralized design process** in which actors
          use the blockchain as a collaboration platform?
